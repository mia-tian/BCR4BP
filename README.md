# BCR4BP using Koon-Lo-Marsden-Ross Initial Guess

This repository calculates trajectories from the Earth to the Moon in the Sun-Earth-Moon bi-circular restricted four body problem using initial guesses in the Sun-Earth CR3BP, then optimize for minimum delta-V.

The initial guesses used comes from _Dynamical Systems, the Three-Body Problem and Space Mission Design_ by Wang Sang Koon, Martin W. Lo, Jerrold E. Marsden, and Shane D. Ross.
